# CS50x - Intro to Computer Science Course

I created this repo to keep track of my progress during the [Harvard's CS50 intro course](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0). This is a faster and easier way for me to remember some of the concepts of the course while doing new tasks from it. 

If you are taking the course and are struggling with some of the assignments, take a look at my repo and see if it can clear your mind. This is not the complete course since I'm still taking it, I'm planning to finish until the end of the year. All of my solutions got a 100% score. Feel free to adjust the solutions to your way of thinking, there is not only one right answer to the problems.

Hope it helps in some way. If you liked my solutions, please, leave me a star =)

## DISCLAIMER:
Use the code in this repo as a inspiration to your own code or a way to clear some doubts, don't just copy it without trying to solve the problem sets yourself. The best way to learn to code is not copying code, it is writing your own. Read about Harvard's [Academy Honesty](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty) before using my solutions in your code.
